# Hello Page

### Rename your fork

I forked this!  Now editing ReadMe.  


### Make yours live

1. From your fork's page on GitHub, click the index.html link, then on the next page click Edit.
2. Make changes to the HTML so that the site reflects your name and bio.
8. At the bottom of the site, click the Commit button to save your changes.

Now your site is live! Go check it out!


### Style

There are basic styles included in `style.css` but go wild and make it your own, try other things!

### Bonus Style

![2](screenshot2.png)

There is another style option included within this repository. If you change the CSS file specified on **line 7** in `index.html` to:

```HTML
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/style.css"
```

Then you'll get the other option! Commit your changes to make it live. Change the file called for back to `css/style2.css` to go back to the other.
